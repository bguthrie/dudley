install instructions:

    git clone $DUDLEY_URL
    heroku create
    heroku addons:add heroku-postgresql:dev
    heroku pg:promote HEROKU_POSTGRESQL_TEAL # or whatever color [@@automatable?]
    heroku pg:psql < schema.sql
    
    heroku config:add GIT_URL=[path to your git repo]
    git push heroku master

next up to do:

 - check status codes to make sure build succeeded
 - web interface to watch builds
 - watchdb: spawn builders
 
 Key management
   Create a new heroku account
   Generate a new key for it
   Put the privkey in the dudley config
   Put the password in the Dudley config (see if you can get a token)
   Grant the new account access to the build server
   Then build has to log in to heroku
 
 
 Htmlize
   Courier callback takes escape codes
   Convert escape coded to HTML before printing to browser
    Anyone we need to persuade that we're a tty?
 
 Rebuild
      Marks job uncompleted
      But make sure we don't push to production
        Don't force on production

 
 - have courier update the db even if there's no command output:
